## Typescript

Using TypeScript, even for small projects with tight deadlines, offers several benefits:

- **Type Safety**: TypeScriptâ€™s static typing helps catch errors early, reducing runtime issues and improving code reliability.
- **Improved Readability**: Clearer type definitions make the codebase easier to understand, which is beneficial for quick onboarding and collaboration.
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: TypeScript provides better autocompletion and refactoring tools in IDEs, speeding up development and reducing the likelihood of errors.
- **Better Documentation**: The type system acts as built-in documentation, making it easier to understand how different parts of the code interact.
- **Easier Refactoring**: Type safety simplifies refactoring, allowing developers to make changes confidently without worrying about breaking the code.
- **Future Scalability**: Starting with TypeScript prepares the project for potential future growth, making it easier to scale and maintain.
- **Consistent Code Quality**: Enforcing type rules helps maintain a consistent coding style, which can improve maintainability even in small projects.
- **Community and Ecosystem**: TypeScript has strong community support and a rich ecosystem of libraries, many of which offer type definitions.

> Even under pressure, these advantages can lead to faster development cycles and reduced debugging time.

## Styled-components

Styled-components offer a streamlined approach to styling by allowing you to write CSS directly within JavaScript, ensuring scoped, dynamic, and themeable styles. This leads to cleaner, more maintainable code with better performance and easier styling management.

Here is a difference between Tailwind CSS and Styled-components:

| Feature                   | Tailwind CSS                                     | Styled Components                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class Name Complexity     | Requires memorization of many class names        | Uses familiar CSS syntax, easier to read                                           |
| Media Queries             | Requires separate CSS for media queries          | Built-in support for media queries in JS                                           |
| Code Readability          | Can lead to cluttered HTML with numerous classes | Keeps styles encapsulated, improving readability                                   |
| Dynamic Styling           | Limited dynamic styling capabilities             | Fully dynamic styles based on props                                                |
| Maintenance               | Harder to maintain due to class name clutter     | Easier to manage with component-based structure                                    |
| CSS Knowledge Requirement | Basic CSS knowledge still beneficial             | Encourages understanding of CSS principles                                         |
| Accessibility Support     | Requires additional setup for accessible classes | Facilitates the implementation of ARIA roles and attributes directly in components |

## SCSS

- CSS preprocessor for modular and scalable stylesheets.
- Variables, mixins, and nested rules for efficient styling.

## Husky and commitlint:

- Git hooks and commit message linting to enforce coding standards.
- Consistent commit history and improved code review process.

## Dockerfile:

- Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- Simplified setup and deployment processes.
