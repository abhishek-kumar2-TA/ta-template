# Best Practices

## Atomic Design

Break down UI components into smaller, reusable building blocks following the Atomic Design methodology. Start with atoms (e.g., buttons, inputs), combine them into molecules (e.g., form groups), then create organisms (e.g., navigation bars), and finally templates and pages. This approach promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability, making your codebase scalable and easy to manage.

## Descriptive Naming Conventions

Use clear and meaningful names for variables, functions, and components. Avoid cryptic abbreviations and unclear shorthand. Descriptive names improve code readability and maintainability, ensuring that your code is intuitive for current and future developers.

## Code Consistency & Formatting

Adhere to a consistent coding style across the project by configuring Prettier for automated formatting. Use a linter (e.g., ESLint) to enforce these rules, which helps maintain a clean, standardized codebase and reduces errors caused by inconsistent formatting.

## Testing

Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your components and utilities. Use Jest for running tests and React Testing Library for testing React components. Prioritize test coverage to prevent regressions and improve code quality.

## Commit Message Conventions

Follow a clear commit message format, such as Conventional Commits, to maintain a clean Git history and enable better version control. Use tools like commitlint to enforce these standards, ensuring commit messages are consistent, informative, and meaningful.

## Component Structure

Organize UI components following Atomic Design principles, breaking them down into smaller, reusable pieces. This helps maintain a consistent structure and improves the scalability of your project by making each component independently testable and replaceable.

## State Management

Use React Context or custom hooks for managing global state. Avoid using Redux unless absolutely necessary, as it can introduce unnecessary complexity. This promotes a simpler, more maintainable state management solution for most applications.

## SCSS and Styling

When using SCSS, follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) convention for class names to ensure scalability and avoid conflicts in larger projects. Write reusable, modular styles that are easy to maintain and extend.

## Styled-Components Usage

For styling, use styled-components for all CSS-in-JS needs. Name styled components using PascalCase (e.g., Button, CardContainer), and avoid abbreviations in component or variable names (e.g., use backgroundColor instead of bgColor). This ensures consistency and clarity in your styling code.

## Accessibility

Ensure that all UI components are accessible by adhering to best practices in accessibility. Use semantic HTML, include ARIA attributes where necessary, and make sure your app supports keyboard navigation. This ensures your app is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.
